career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a dedicated mechanical engineer specializing in solid mechanics, with a strong academic and research background. 
      I completed my M.Sc. at the University of Tehran (2021-2024), where I focused on the electromechanical performance of metamaterial dielectric elastomer actuators.
      Prior to that, I earned my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Bu-Ali Sina University (2016-2021). 
      Professionally, I have worked as a research assistant and teaching assistant at the University of Tehran, supervising students in the Smart Materials & Structures Lab. 
      I also serve as a peer reviewer for renowned scientific journals and have gained practical experience through part-time 3D printing operations and as a junior engineer at MDFICO in the casting and QC departments. 
      Additionally, I interned at IKCO, working in the engine and QC departments, further honing my engineering skills.
